# MiniPaint
This app allows the user to use their phone screen as a "paint" canvas to draw with their fingers.  It is a modern day Etch A Sketch for your phone. Simply turn your phone to erase the screen and start over with a blank canvas. 

See visual below which shows the app in action

This app was developed while following a tutorial from the Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree training program. The lesson covered 2D drawing surface.
